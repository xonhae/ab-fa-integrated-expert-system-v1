## Overview

Cohere's current web presence feels like a sober enterprise AI command center with editorial restraint. The home page opens on a huge typographic declaration over a white canvas, then uses photography, dark product mockups, trust logos, and generous empty space to make AI infrastructure feel controlled rather than speculative. Product pages invert the tone into deep green-black or dark navy bands, while blog and research pages move toward publishing-system clarity: large filters, thin rules, dense lists, and pale technical backgrounds.

What makes the system distinctive is the mix of austere black-and-white UI with bursts of tactile brand imagery. The site avoids decorative chrome in the normal interface; color arrives through photography, abstract 3D media, coral blog taxonomy chips, blue research links, and dark product environments. Cards are rounded but not cute. Type is large, tight, and almost monospaced in spirit, creating a research-lab cadence across marketing, product, and editorial surfaces.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Monumental display headlines with very tight line height and negative tracking.
- White editorial canvases interrupted by deep green, dark navy, and image-led CTA bands.
- Rounded media cards and product cards, usually 8px to 22px.
- Pill CTAs in near-black or white, with most secondary actions rendered as underlined text links.
- Trust-logo strips with monochrome partner marks and very wide vertical spacing.
- Agent-console mockups using dark panels, small status chips, and product integration badges.
- Blog and research surfaces with prominent taxonomy chips, long rule-separated lists, and search fields.
